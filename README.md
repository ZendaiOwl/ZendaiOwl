## General information about me

Hello! My name is Victor-ray and I'm currently working full-time as Customer Support Representative at Majorel for Netflix here in Amsterdam while simultaneously getting my degree in Development of e-Services at [University Dalarna](https://www.du.se/sv/Utbildning/Program/utveckling-av-etjanster/). 

I‚Äôm looking to work as a Developer since that is more of my passion, to develop and build something that others find interesting, enjoy or simply is useful for them in their everyday lives. 

I currently have a little side-project together with my studies, having set up a Raspberry Pi 4 model B rev.1.2 with a NextcloudPi instance and keeping that up and running to get some admin experience. 

I‚Äôm also helping out as a Volunteer being a NextcloudPi Wiki Moderator and NCP Documentation Volunteer. 

We are currently migrating all the documentation from https://docs.nextcloudpi.com to  its own Category in the Nextcloud forum instead called ‚ÄúNCP Documentation‚Äù, this migration is still in-progress but you can find my profile [here](https://help.nextcloud.com/u/ZendaiOwl/summary) if it is something that might be of interest to look at. 

I also have some plans on creating something on the Algorand blockchain where I‚Äôm currently a Governor in the first Governor round, but that is something that will have to come later.
